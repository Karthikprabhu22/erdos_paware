    "# Exploring the data\n",
    "## Non-Unique Values\n",
    "Some observations about the values in in the `reddit_text` column of the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are 38924 non-unique values that appear in a total of 306,242 rows\n",
    "* There are 5222056 rows with unique values (~94.46\\% of all rows)\n",
    "* Emojis apear frequenlty, and BERT models treat emojis as \"unknown\" tokens\n",
    "* Many, many (>100,000) non-unique entries appear to be some flavor of \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Thank you\".\n",
    "    * These might be particularly useful for adding some sort of \"sentiment of replies\" metadata to other rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the non-unique values:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The values `\"\"`, `\"[deleted]\"`, and `\"[removed]\"` make up a total of 77,914 rows (a little over 25\\% of all non-unique values)\n",
    "    * My initial impression is that rows with values of `\"[deleted]\"`, and `\"[removed]\"` can safely be removed from the dataset.\n",
    "    * The value `\"\"` only appears as a *comment* 6 times. In all 42340 other instances it is a *submission*.\n",
    "        * Manual inspection of the 6 *comment* instances seems to indicate that these posts we edited to be empty by the author, but not deleted. They can be safely dropped.\n",
    "        * A cursory inspection of a sample of the *submission* instances seems to indicate that many of these fall into one of these situations:\n",
    "            * The submission title is the question or statement to which comments that follow are responding to\n",
    "            * The submission is an image with no text (often still with some information in the title).\n",
    "        * My initial impression was that we could either just delete these posts, or replace their `reddit_text` value with the value in `reddit_title`\n",
    "        * These values only make up ~0.77\\% of all values in the `reddit_text` column, but in a few subreddits they make up a larger proprtion:\n",
    "            * In `FedEmployees` 107 of the total 280 posts (~38\\%)\n",
    "            * In  `disney`: 2555 of 43954 (~5.8\\%)\n",
    "            * In `RiteAid`: 170 of 3970 (~4.3%)\n",
    "            * In `PaneraEmployees`: 115 of 2694 (4.3\\%)\n",
    "            * In `WalmartEmployees`: 285 of 10752 (2.7\\%)\n",
    "            * In all others, <2\\%.\n",
    "* Probably about 10,000 additional posts can be attributed to bots and can likely be safely removed."
