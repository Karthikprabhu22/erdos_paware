You sat there on Wednesday and bragged about how great all our new vehicles are as we pull in record profits quarter after quarter in a bad economy (all done under the WA model). And yet SLT would have you believe that we’re all unproductive and getting rid of WA is the only solution. We’re not asking for more money, or a 4 day work week or anything like that. This is free, makes your workers happy, and doesn’t seem to alter productivity one bit. So why? I just don’t get it. Why with all our “success” recently, do you want to just throw a grenade into the mix. I’m just baffled, it doesn’t make any sense. Why?? Because the city of Warren wants the economic benefit? Have you ever been to the tech center? It’s massive and just going across the street to Wendy’s takes up 90% of your lunch break. Hardly anybody goes out for lunch or stops somewhere around there after work.  Or even better, as they said on Wednesday, you’re worried about Continental and Starbucks “making a profit”. Are you fucking kidding me? You’re worried about them and their $15 sandwiches and not your own employees? What is wrong with you people?\n",

Nothing. Why don’t you get rid of Dress Appropritly next. Dress better, feel better, work better, am I right? Suit and ties for everyone. Who cares that that would piss everyone off and hinder productivity. I don’t care that this is a free compensation tool that places like banks can’t offer.
