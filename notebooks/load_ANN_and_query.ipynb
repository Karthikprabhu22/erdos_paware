Don’t tell me how ridiculous is it. I don’t care. I just work here. If you don’t like our straws, don’t use them. If you think our table are sticky, it’s the customers who did it, so get mad at them. We wipe our tables multiple times a day. If you think we use too much ice, maybe order light ice? If you think our sizing if stupid, all you have to do is say small, medium, or large. Guess what? We know what that means. Unless your barista is the problem, they won’t try to correct you.\n",
       "If you order the wrong size, because you were confused, why do you expect me to remake it? That was your mistake, not mine, but it’s fine. Customers always right. I’ll just ruin my drive thru times, so I can fix that for you. \n",
       "How am I supposed to know how to spell your name? Half the time when I’m working the register, I have to ask, which doesn’t seem like a big deal, but we’re basically always in a rush. Literally every second counts. Plus the cafe gets kind of loud when it’s busy, so I have to have people repeat themselves a lot, which takes more time. \n",
       "How am I supposed to know how to pronounce your name when I’m it calling it out to the cafe? Sometimes whoever is on front will spell your name wrong on purpose so that it’s easy for the barista to call out when they’re finished making it. Get over it. I feel bad pronouncing your name wrong. I feel a little stupid when you and your friends giggle and whisper. It’s a big joke about how Starbucks baristas always get names wrong, but I don’t understand how you expect me to just know. I made what you ordered. It’s ready. I did it as fast as I could. I tried to pronounce your name, and I called out the actual name of the drink as well. Sorry if that’s not enough, but I have a lot more to worry about. \n",
       "Why do you and 5 other cars show up 10 minutes before we close with your entire family? Why would you think that’s okay? I’ve tried to talk to my fellow baristas or my shift managers, but they obviously don’t care when they don’t have to make the drinks.

I hate how ignorant half the customers are, only caring about how long they are waiting when they should visibly be able to see that there&#x27;s three baristas running around doing 10 things at once in order to satisfy them. I hate how often customers are mean. I hate how often I see my coworkers cry in the back. I hate going home every day feeling intense back pain. I hate our CEO. I hate Howard Schultz for union busting. I hate Howard for saying that &quot;all corporate meetings, we leave two empty chairs, one for partners and one for customers&quot; when if they really cared, they could just have us at the meetings!! I hate the fake attitude. I hate them calling us partners, when they see us as pawns in their money game. I hate being brutally honest in the partner experience surveys, just for them to make things worse for us constantly because they couldn&#x27;t care less. I hate overexerting myself constantly, just to have rude customers be all dramatic that their order took ten minutes. I hate my manager, who constantly talks behind everyone&#x27;s backs and creates a toxic environment. I hate her for never acknowledging how hard things are for us, and for constantly praising this company as if they care about her too. I hate that she wins several awards a year for managing the best performing store in the district, when it&#x27;s us baristas who are achieving these excellent drive through times and connection scores, not her!

       "• Dealing with some ... interesting people. At my particular location, I&#x27;m in the rougher part of town and people don&#x27;t think twice about cussing, yelling, and making a ruckus. That was and still is at time a shock to me because I never worked in a branch with tolerance to that kind of behavior. I am naturally someone who doesn&#x27;t like to get involved with conflict, too. And while it&#x27;s listed as a negative for me, I have had to get stern with people who were regular rough-necks and tell them I want to help them but can&#x27;t with cussing and yelling - you&#x27;d be surprised how many of them straighten up and now they come to me for everything (new grandbaby birth announcements, loan requests, referring business). Thus also has helped me build my confidence in handling difficult situations and conversations. \n",

       "But I don&#x27;t love my job unfortunately. It sucks. This job could be so much fun. It SHOULD feel fun. I hate this company and how little they care about us. I hate that baristas aren&#x27;t seen as people by starbucks. I hate constantly being understaffed because they think it&#x27;s okay to have three people on the floor when there&#x27;s 30 customers in the cafe and a long drive through line. I hate how ignorant half the customers are, only caring about how long they are waiting when they should visibly be able to see that there&#x27;s three baristas running around doing 10 things at once in order to satisfy them. I hate how often customers are mean. I hate how often I see my coworkers cry in the back. I hate going home every day feeling intense back pain. I hate our CEO. I hate Howard Schultz for union busting. I hate Howard for saying that &quot;all corporate meetings, we leave two empty chairs, one for partners and one for customers&quot; when if they really cared, they could just have us at the meetings!! I hate the fake attitude. I hate them calling us partners, when they see us as pawns in their money game. I hate being brutally honest in the partner experience surveys, just for them to make things worse for us constantly because they couldn&#x27;t care less. I hate overexerting myself constantly, just to have rude customers be all dramatic that their order took ten minutes. I hate my manager, who constantly talks behind everyone&#x27;s backs and creates a toxic environment. I hate her for never acknowledging how hard things are for us, and for constantly praising this company as if they care about her too. I hate that she wins several awards a year for managing the best performing store in the district, when it&#x27;s us baristas who are achieving these excellent drive through times and connection scores, not her! I hate robotic district managers that do nothing. I hate how much money they spend on union busting instead of just paying us more. \n",
