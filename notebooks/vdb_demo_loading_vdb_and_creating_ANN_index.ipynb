It seemed like an easy win win. GM can compete with the big boys without having to spend like them, and doesn’t have to give much up.

       "So I’m just confused. From every indicator, we’re doing pretty well in an otherwise rough economic environment. You sat there on Wednesday and bragged about how great all our new vehicles are as we pull in record profits quarter after quarter in a bad economy (all done under the WA model). And yet SLT would have you believe that we’re all unproductive and getting rid of WA is the only solution. We’re not asking for more money, or a 4 day work week or anything like that. This is free, makes your workers happy, and doesn’t seem to alter productivity one bit. So why? I just don’t get it. Why with all our “success” recently, do you want to just throw a grenade into the mix. I’m just baffled, it doesn’t make any sense. Why?? Because the city of Warren wants the economic benefit? Have you ever been to the tech center? It’s massive and just going across the street to Wendy’s takes up 90% of your lunch break. Hardly anybody goes out for lunch or stops somewhere around there after work.  Or even better, as they said on Wednesday, you’re worried about Continental and Starbucks “making a profit”. Are you fucking kidding me? You’re worried about them and their $15 sandwiches and not your own employees? What is wrong with you people?\n",

       "I know some think us complaining about this are just lazy and want to keep working in our PJ’s. Yeah maybe that’s true for some. But you can’t argue with the fact that all this push does, is piss A LOT of your employees off and throw a wrench into an otherwise good “system”, by taking away something that cost you nothing. Nothing. Why don’t you get rid of Dress Appropritly next. Dress better, feel better, work better, am I right? Suit and ties for everyone. Who cares that that would piss everyone off and hinder productivity. I don’t care that this is a free compensation tool that places like banks can’t offer. Let’s get those linemen in the plants in suits asap. “I know I work better in a suit”-Mark. \n",

You sat there on Wednesday and bragged about how great all our new vehicles are as we pull in record profits quarter after quarter in a bad economy (all done under the WA model). And yet SLT would have you believe that we’re all unproductive and getting rid of WA is the only solution. We’re not asking for more money, or a 4 day work week or anything like that. This is free, makes your workers happy, and doesn’t seem to alter productivity one bit. So why? I just don’t get it. Why with all our “success” recently, do you want to just throw a grenade into the mix. I’m just baffled, it doesn’t make any sense. Why?? Because the city of Warren wants the economic benefit? Have you ever been to the tech center? It’s massive and just going across the street to Wendy’s takes up 90% of your lunch break. Hardly anybody goes out for lunch or stops somewhere around there after work.  Or even better, as they said on Wednesday, you’re worried about Continental and Starbucks “making a profit”. Are you fucking kidding me? You’re worried about them and their $15 sandwiches and not your own employees? What is wrong with you people?\n",

Nothing. Why don’t you get rid of Dress Appropritly next. Dress better, feel better, work better, am I right? Suit and ties for everyone. Who cares that that would piss everyone off and hinder productivity. I don’t care that this is a free compensation tool that places like banks can’t offer.

Office employees really had a fantastic adjustment.  Do I think the RTO has logic built around it? Meh, not so much (see our results remote).  But what I do think is happening is a political and financial strain on cities due to it.  These are real issues that are caused by an amazing adjustment for humans for work.  May cities have increased income tax to offset money.  You have to remember GM is tied to a lot of people and other companies and we are influenced by where $$ and support come from.  So, I think RTO is great for the company on the finacial aspect.  I do not think its great for team morale, WLB and being a employer for the people.  People will always want to work for GM.  Its GM.
